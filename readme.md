# HDI_Context_Web_Area

With 4D 20 R9, 4D introduces new commands that allow developers to define an object context for $4d, ensuring only specific functions are exposed. Previously, using $4d meant exposing 4D methods to the web area, but now, you can define and use class functions instead. This improvement allows for better organization, encapsulation, and security when integrating 4D functionalities into web areas.
